Specs:

 [X] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
 My executable file ./bin/healthy_foods calls on the cli.rb in my lib/healthy_foods folder.  When I've called the executable from Terminal, it loads the cli.rb correctly, and my program is presented.  I interact with the program as a User will eventually as well, so I think I've done this correctly.

 [X] Pull data from an external source
 I am scraping from http://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php for the list function.  My Scraper class pulls from this website correctly.

 [X] Implement both list and detail views
 I am scraping from the URI above for the list view, and then from the individual pages of the links for the detail views.
